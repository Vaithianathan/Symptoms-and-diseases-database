About this application:

Symptoms-and-diseases-database (SADDB) is a web/intranet application written in PHP that can be
used as a database for storing patients data, diseases, and symptoms. Most of the code of SADDB 
was automatically generated by AppGini, a web application generator that you can find more about
at http://bigprof.com/appgini.



System requirements:

SADDB can run on any web server with PHP 4.3 or higher and MySQL 3.25 or higher installed.
If you want to use/test it on your own computer, the easiest way is to install XAMPP from
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html



Installation:

1. Create an empty mysql database on your server (usually done from your hosting control panel)
and assign a username and password to access it.

2. Upload all the files and sub folders in this folder into your web/intranet server. Let's say
your server is my-server.com and that you uploaded SADDB to a folder named "SADDB" under your
public_html folder (or whatever your web root is named). So, you can access the program from:
http://my-server.com/SADDB

Just follow the setup screens you'll see when accessing the above address, and you're done.




Usage:

1. Login as admin.
2. Define one or more symptoms from the symptoms page.
3. Define one or more diseases from the diseases page.
4. After defining a disease, when you click on it from the diseases list, you can see the
   "Disease symptoms" button above the disease details. Click on that button then click on
   "Add new" to assign one or more syptoms to the disease.
5. Once you've added the relevent diseases and their symptoms, you can now start adding patients
   and for each patient you can add observed symptoms.


More info, adding more features, ... etc:

SADDB was generated by AppGini (http://bigprof.com/appgini) ... You can easily customize it by
opening the file "symptoms_and_diseases.axp" in AppGini and making all changes you wish to (add 
more fields, more tables, ... etc), then click the Generate icon and re-upload the generated code.
No programming skills necessary!
